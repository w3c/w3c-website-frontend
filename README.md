## Site URLs

### Production
Live:
* https://www.w3.org
* https://www.w3.org/_build_summary.json (very brief summary of latest deployment)

### Staging
* https://www-staging.w3.org
* https://www-staging.w3.org/_build_summary.json

### Development
* https://www-dev.w3.org
* https://www-dev.w3.org/_build_summary.json

Used to test new functionality / changes. Access to development is restricted by IP address.

### Local
* http://localhost:8000/ (see [running application locally](#running-application-locally)) 

## Deployment

The project uses [Deployer](https://deployer.org/) to perform deployment.

Please note this project uses a local instance of Deployer (installed via Composer), as opposed to a global version of Deployer.

To run deployments please use:

````
vendor/bin/dep deploy <environment>
````

To deploy a specific branch use

````
vendor/bin/dep deploy <environment> --branch=<branch_name>
````

E.g.

```
vendor/bin/dep deploy development --branch=feature/my-branch-name
```

### SSH access
To connect to the server directly at the correct path for an environments current release, run the following from the root of the project

````
vendor/bin/dep ssh <environment>
````

## Updating HTML templates

The HTML templates are stored in [w3c-website-templates-bundle](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-website-templates-bundle)

These can be updated by deploying changes to the [design system](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-website-templates-bundle/blob/main/design-system.md) 
and running `composer update` in this project.

You can also test changes either by deploying a branch to the staging environment for the design system, or by [testing a development branch on the frontend website](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-website-templates-bundle/blob/main/design-system.md#testing-a-development-branch-on-your-front-end-website). 

## Installation
w
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

More on the [Git workflow for this project](docs/git_workflow.md).

### Requirements

* PHP 8.1+
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download#step-1-install-symfony-cli)

### Clone the repository

`git clone git@github.com:w3c/website-frontend.git`

### Install Composer dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

***Note:*** If you already have this project installed locally and you're having trouble seeing any changes, make sure you have cleared your Symfony cache using the `bin/console cache:clear` command.

### Configuration

Create a local env file:

```
touch .env.local
```

And set:
* APP_ENV (dev, staging, prod)
* APP_URL
* CRAFTCMS_API_URL
* CRAFTCMS_API_READ_TOKEN
* CRAFTCMS_API_PUBLISH_TOKEN 

You can find your API Read and Publish tokens by going to the Craft CMS dashboard (see the [Craft repo](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-website-craft)).

You can check what env files are being loaded in your environment by running `php bin/console debug:dotenv`

### Running application locally

Before running the below command, please ensure you have the [Symfony CLI installed](https://symfony.com/download#step-1-install-symfony-cli)

Once you have the Symfony CLI installed (or you have ensured you already have it installed), you can run the frontend application locally at http://localhost:8000/ by running

```
symfony server:start
```
In your terminal

***Note:*** A good way to test if something will break if you deploy it to live is to switch your local envâ€™s CraftCMS API URL and Read and Publish tokens to the production CMS
**(Please be careful about any changes you make in the Production CMS as they will be visible on the live site)**

## Built with

- [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)
- [Craft CMS API](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/graphql.html)
- [Strata Frontend](https://github.com/strata/frontend)
- [W3C Design System](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-website-templates-bundle/) (used as a Symfony template bundle)
