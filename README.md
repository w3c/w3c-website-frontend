### Local
* http://localhost:8000/ (see [running application locally](#running-application-locally)) 

## Deployment (TBC)

The project uses [Deployer](https://deployer.org/) to perform deployment. For full deployment details/options view [docs/deployment](docs/deployment.md)

Please note this project uses a local instance of Deployer (installed via Composer), as opposed to a global version of Deployer. This is so we
can make use of other Composer packages in deployment tasks reliably (otherwise there can be clashes between global and local version of the same packages).

To run deployments please use:

````
vendor/bin/dep deploy <environment>
````

To deploy a specific branch use

````
vendor/bin/dep deploy <environment> --branch=<branch_name>
````

E.g.

```
vendor/bin/dep deploy development --branch=develop
```

### SSH access
To connect to the server directly at the correct path for an environments current release, run the following from the root of the project

````
vendor/bin/dep ssh <environment>
````

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
